  "Channel sockets. Otherwise known as The Shiz.

      Protocol  | client>server | client>server + ack/reply | server>user[1] push
    * WebSockets:       ✓              [2]                          ✓  ; [3]
    * Ajax:            [4]              ✓                          [5] ; [3]

    [1] ALL of a user's connected clients (browser tabs, devices, etc.).
        Note that user > session > client > connection for consistency over time
        + multiple devices.
    [2] Emulate with cb-uuid wrapping.
    [3] By uid only (=> logged-in users only).
    [4] Emulate with dummy-cb wrapping.
    [5] Emulate with long-polling against uid (=> logged-in users only).

  Abbreviations:
    * chsk  - channel socket.
    * hk-ch - Http-kit Channel.
    * uid   - User id. An application-specified identifier unique to each user
              and sessionized under `:uid` key to enable server>user push.
              May have semantic meaning (e.g. username, email address), or not
              (e.g. random uuid) - app's discresion.
    * cb    - callback.
    * tout  - timeout.
    * ws    - WebSocket/s.

  Special messages (implementation detail):
    * cb replies: :chsk/closed, :chsk/timeout, :chsk/error.
    * client-side events:
        [:chsk/handshake <#{:ws :ajax}>],
        [:chsk/ping      <#{:ws :ajax}>], ; Though no :ajax ping
        [:chsk/state [<#{:open :first-open :closed}> <#{:ws :ajax}]],
        [:chsk/recv  <[buffered-evs]>]. ; server>user push

    * server-side events:
       [:chsk/bad-edn <edn>],
       [:chsk/bad-event <chsk-event>].

    * event wrappers: {:chsk/clj <clj> :chsk/dummy-cb? true} (for [2]),
                      {:chsk/clj <clj> :chsk/cb-uuid <uuid>} (for [4]).

  Notable implementation details:
    * Edn is used as a flexible+convenient transfer format, but can be seen as
      an implementation detail. Users may apply additional string encoding (e.g.
      JSON) at will. (This would incur a cost, but it'd be negligable compared
      to even the fastest network transfer times).
    * No server>client (with/without cb) mechanism is provided since:
      - server>user is what people actually want 90% of the time, and is a
        preferable design pattern in general IMO.
      - server>client could be (somewhat inefficiently) simulated with server>user.
    * core.async is used liberally where brute-force core.async allows for
      significant implementation simplifications. We lean on core.async's strong
      efficiency here.

  General-use notes:
    * Single HTTP req+session persists over entire chsk session but cannot
      modify sessions! Use standard a/sync HTTP Ring req/resp for logins, etc.
    * Easy to wrap standard HTTP Ring resps for transport over chsks. Prefer
      this approach to modifying handlers (better portability)."
